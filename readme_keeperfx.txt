KeeperFX is a executable mod for Dungeon Keeper.

It is written by fans and not supported by original developer.
Still, it requires original Dungeon Keeper to work.

Installation:

Just copy all the files into your Dungeon Keeper directory.
Run "keeperfx.exe" to start the game.

Version: 0.11
  Managed to make the DLL working (at last!)


Programming:
 Tomasz Lis aka Mefistotelis

Part of the code closed into DLL is copyrighted
 by Bullfrog.
